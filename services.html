                            For multiple use, the program constantly stores all data about customers, their addresses, etc., and also, for convenience,

                            All information is found instantly according to the desired fragments of it (criteria). The criteria are summed up.
                            (For example: while talking on the phone, it is enough to enter the last few digits of the caller's phone number and 
                            the program will "select" all relevant customers. By additionally entering a fragment of the city name (or any other criterion), 
                            even more accurate information is "selected").
