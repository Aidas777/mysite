                            into application during entire period before departure. If necessary (for example, if the client decides to leave later or earlier), 
                            data can be moved to another charters:

                            For multiple use, the program constantly stores all data about customers, their addresses, etc., and also, for convenience, 
                            information about collection-delivery points (called "Collection Points" - when more than one parcel or passenger is picked up at one place). 
                            All information is found instantly according to the desired fragments of it (criteria). The criteria are summed up.
                            (For example: while talking on the phone, it is enough to enter the last few digits of the caller's phone number and 
                            the program will "select" all relevant customers. By additionally entering a fragment of the city name (or any other criterion), 
                            even more accurate information is "selected").

                            The program processes both address and coordinate data (coordinates are especially convenient when there is no exact address - e.g. gas stations, etc.). 
                            Finding address, coordinates or distance on the map is done with just one click.

                            it is possible to adjust the route with one or more button presses (adjustments are also instantly displayed on the map).
